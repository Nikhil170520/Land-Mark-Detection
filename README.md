 # Project Description: Landmark Prediction System
Overview
The Landmark Prediction system is a deep learning-based web application designed to identify landmarks from user-uploaded images. Built using Streamlit, it integrates a TensorFlow Hub model to classify images and predict the corresponding landmark. Additionally, the system retrieves the landmark's address and visualizes its location on an interactive map.

Key Features:
AI-Based Landmark Recognition: Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate landmark classification.
Web Interface (Streamlit): A user-friendly platform where users can upload images and receive predictions in real-time.
Geolocation Extraction: Retrieves and displays the exact address of the predicted landmark.
Map Visualization: Integrates with Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap to show the landmark's location.
Fast & Scalable: Optimized for real-time processing with minimal latency.
Technology Stack:
Front-End: Streamlit (for an interactive web UI)
Back-End: TensorFlow Hub (for deep learning model inference)
Geolocation Services: Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap (for location mapping)
Deployment: Cloud or local server
Applications:
Tourism & Travel: Helps tourists identify landmarks and explore new destinations.
Navigation & Mapping: Enhances location-based services with AI-driven landmark detection.
Education & Cultural Heritage: Assists in learning about historical landmarks with geospatial insights.
This project provides a cost-effective, customizable, and scalable solution for automated landmark identification, bridging AI and geospatial intelligence for a seamless user experience
